This is a gnome-shell extension for saving the current running application as a template workspace and then run it afterwards.

The extension does not work yet as advertised.
It is based on Workspace Indicator by gcampax.

When it will be usable we are going to upload it to the https://extensions.gnome.org/

Feel free to comment, file bugs etc.
