This is a gnome-shell extension for saving the current running application as a template workspace and then run it afterwards.

The extension does not work yet as advertised.
It is based on Workspace Indicator by gcampax.
We also used as a reference the pomodoro shell-extension and the hamster box!

When it will be usable we are going to upload it to the https://extensions.gnome.org/

Feel free to comment, file bugs etc.
